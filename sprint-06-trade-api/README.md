# Sprint 6: the Trade REST API

Everything the platform has built so far is unreachable. The schema answers
psql. The rules answer a JUnit test. Neither answers a customer, and no other
service in the platform can reach either of them. This sprint is the front
door: one HTTP service that accepts an order, proves the caller is who they
claim to be, applies the rules you wrote in Sprint 5, writes the result to the
schema you designed in Sprint 3, and answers in a shape the Angular
application can generate a client from.

Being the front door is the whole of its job. The service does not decide
whether a trade is allowed, because that decision belongs to the domain module
and a second caller reads the same rules from a Kafka consumer next sprint. It
does not price anything, because there is no live quote in this sprint and
pricing belongs to the Trade Executor. What it owns is transport and
persistence: turning JSON into a domain call, turning a domain exception into
a documented error code, and holding one database transaction open around the
work that has to succeed or fail together.

Keeping it thin is not tidiness. In Sprint 7 the same rules run in a second
process, minutes later, against a price that did not exist when the order was
placed. Every rule that leaked into a controller this week has to be written
again there, and the two copies drift. The first drift is a customer whose
order this service accepted and the executor refused.

## What you deliver

| Deliverable | Where it lives |
|---|---|
| Six endpoints implementing `contracts/trade-api.yaml` | `src/main/java/`, under your base package |
| A layered controller, service and mapper structure | as above, one package per layer |
| MyBatis mappers with parameterised statements | `src/main/resources/mapper/`, or annotations on the mapper interfaces |
| One `@ControllerAdvice` producing the error envelope | as above |
| JWT verification on every `/api/v1/**` route | as above |
| Tests, unit and slice, that run without a container | `src/test/java/` |
| A multi-stage `Dockerfile` | this folder |
| Your service added to the root `docker-compose.yml` | repository root |
| The manifest telling the check harness your names | `manifest.env` |

The scaffold gives you the Maven build, the package tree, the configuration
skeleton, the harness and a deliberately bad Dockerfile to improve on. Every
class is yours to write. There are no stubs to fill in: deciding what belongs
in which layer is most of what this sprint assesses.

## The contract is the specification

`contracts/trade-api.yaml` is not documentation of something you build. It is
the thing you build, and it was written before the service existed so that the
Angular application in Sprint 9 can generate a typed client from it without
anyone reading your Java.

Six operations, and the paths, verbs and status codes are fixed.

| Method | Path | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/orders` | The recorded order |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/orders/{id}` | The cancelled order |
| GET | `/api/v1/accounts/{id}` | Account details, both identifiers and the lock version |
| GET | `/api/v1/accounts/{id}/balance` | Available cash and its currency |
| GET | `/api/v1/accounts/{id}/positions` | Holdings with a net quantity above zero |
| GET | `/api/v1/accounts/{id}/orders` | The order history, newest first |

Two parts of the contract are behaviour rather than decoration, and both are
assessed.

**The error envelope.** Every failure leaves the service as
`{"errorCode": "...", "message": "..."}` and nothing else. Not a Spring
whitelabel page, not a stack trace, not a bare status with an empty body. The
Angular application has one error handler because there is one envelope, and
a route that answers a validation failure in a different shape from a business
failure forces the client to branch on the status code instead.

**Every code in the catalogue.** Seven codes, and the mapping to HTTP status is
in the contract. Clients branch on `errorCode` and never on the status alone,
because 404 and 409 each carry more than one code.

| Code | HTTP | Raised when |
|---|---|---|
| `ACC-404` | 404 | No account exists with that key |
| `ACC-403` | 403 | The account is not `ACTIVE`, or the token does not reach it |
| `INS-404` | 404 | The instrument is unknown or no longer tradable |
| `ORD-400` | 400 | A buy costs more than the available cash |
| `ORD-409` | 409 | Insufficient holdings, a reused idempotency key, or an order that cannot be cancelled |
| `VAL-422` | 422 | The request failed field validation |
| `AUTH-401` | 401 | Missing, malformed, expired or wrongly signed token |

`message` is for a human reading a screen. It never carries a class name, a SQL
fragment, an account key or an internal identifier. Values an investigation
needs are logged on the server, where the customer cannot read them. Leaking
them in a response body is the OWASP finding you covered in Sprint 2.

The response bodies are the schemas in the contract, field for field. Note
that `AccountResponse` is the one place in the platform where `accountId`
means the string business reference rather than the numeric key, and that
`AccountResponse.id` is what every other endpoint calls `accountId`. The
contract explains why. Getting this wrong compiles and passes your own tests,
and breaks the generated client in Sprint 9.

## Layering, stated concretely

Three layers, and each one is allowed to speak exactly one language.

| Layer | Speaks | Must not |
|---|---|---|
| Controller | HTTP, DTOs, status codes, validation annotations | Contain SQL, open a transaction, or hold a business rule |
| Service | The domain module, mappers, one transaction | Take a servlet type, a request object or a status code as a parameter |
| Mapper | SQL, parameterised, and result mapping | Decide anything, or reach back into HTTP |

Two violations fail review on sight.

**SQL in a controller.** A query written in the class that handles the request
cannot be tested without a web layer, cannot be reused by the service that
needs the same rows next sprint, and puts the shape of your schema in the same
file as the shape of your JSON. When the schema moves, the controller changes,
and nothing about the transport changed.

**An HTTP type in the domain.** The domain module you published in Sprint 5
must still build with no servlet API and no Spring on its classpath. A domain
exception that carries an HTTP status, an entity annotated for a web
framework, or a rule that takes a request DTO has bound the rules to one
caller. The Trade Executor in Sprint 7 is the second caller, it has no HTTP
request, and it needs the same rules unchanged.

The harness checks the first by reading your controller sources for mapper,
JDBC and MyBatis imports, and the second by reading the compiled classes of
your Sprint 5 artefact. Neither check can see a rule you wrote in a controller
without touching a mapper, which is why the layering is also read by a human.

## MyBatis, and why interpolation is a security finding

Persistence is MyBatis: mapper interfaces in Java, statements in XML under
`src/main/resources/mapper/` or in annotations on the interface. Either style
is acceptable and the scaffold assumes XML, because a long statement is easier
to read and to review outside a Java string.

Every value that comes from outside the service is bound with `#{}`. MyBatis
turns `#{}` into a JDBC bind parameter: the driver sends the statement and the
value separately, the database parses the statement once, and no value the
caller sends can change what the statement does.

`${}` is a string substitution performed before the statement reaches the
driver. A symbol of `AAPL' OR '1'='1` written into a statement with `${}`
becomes part of the statement, and the account whose positions come back is
whichever account the attacker asked for. That is OWASP A03, injection, and in
this service the values arriving from outside include an account key, a
symbol, a status filter and two timestamps.

The harness fails the build on any `${}` in a mapper. There is one legitimate
use, a column name or a sort direction that cannot be a bind parameter, and it
is legitimate only when the value is checked against a fixed list of permitted
names before it reaches the statement. If you need it, declare the file and the
token in `MAPPER_SQL_INTERPOLATION_ALLOWLIST` in `manifest.env`, with a comment
saying what constrains the value. The allowlist ships empty, and an entry in it
is a question you will be asked in the review.

## Optimistic locking on the account version column

Sprint 3 put a version column on the account row and Sprint 5 had the domain
report the version it was loaded at. This is the sprint where it does something.

Two requests arrive for account 3 at the same moment. Account 3 holds 25,000.
The first is a buy costing 20,000, the second a buy costing 20,000.

Without a lock, both requests read the row and both see 25,000. The first
computes 5,000 and writes it. The second, holding the balance it read a
millisecond earlier, computes 5,000 and writes it. Both orders are recorded,
both are filled, 40,000 of stock has been bought, and the account has 5,000
left instead of being 15,000 overdrawn. One of the two updates was lost. There
is no error, no log line and no symptom until somebody reconciles the cash
against the order history, which in a real firm happens the next morning.

Optimistic locking closes it by making the version part of the write rather
than a check before it. The update names the version the row held when it was
read, and increments it. The database serialises the two writes: the first
affects one row, the second affects none, because the version it named is no
longer there. Zero rows affected is not success. The service that gets it must
refuse the order rather than apply a balance computed from data that has since
moved, and the caller sees `ORD-409`.

Two things follow. Read the version with the row, do not fetch it separately.
Return the affected row count from the mapper, because a mapper that returns
`void` has thrown away the only evidence that anything happened.

The same reasoning applies to the order state transition behind
`DELETE /api/v1/orders/{id}`. Reading the status, deciding it is `NEW` and then
updating it races anything else that touches the order. Make the transition
conditional on the state you expect, in one statement, and treat zero rows as
the refusal it is.

## The auth stub

`services/auth-stub` is provided. It is a fixture, not a deliverable: nothing
in it is assessed, nothing in it is to be modified, and it exists because
Sprint 6 has to verify a real token and Node is not taught until Sprint 8.

Start it with the infrastructure:

```bash
docker compose --profile platform up -d --build
```

Obtain a token, then send it:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3001/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"demo1","password":"Trainee#2026"}'

curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/accounts/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"
```

`services/auth-stub/README.md` lists the five demo users, the claims the token
carries and the shared signing secret. Read it before writing the verifier.

Verification means checking the signature, the expiry and the algorithm the
token asks for, in that order, before reading a single claim. A verifier that
decodes the payload first and checks the signature afterwards has already
trusted whatever the client sent. The signing secret is `JWT_SECRET` from the
environment, shared with whatever issued the token, and it is never a literal
in a properties file.

Four failures are one answer. A missing header, a wrong scheme, an expired
token and a forged signature all produce `AUTH-401` with the same body. A more
specific message tells an attacker which of the four they got wrong, which is
a free oracle and costs you nothing to avoid.

Authentication and authorisation are different questions and belong in
different places. Whether the caller holds a valid token is answered once, for
every route under `/api/v1/`, before any controller runs. Whether that caller
may reach the account in the request is answered where the account key is
known, and the answer is `ACC-403` with the same message a suspended account
gets, so that nobody can enumerate account keys by reading which of the two
came back.

Sprint 8 replaces the stub with the real service. The claims, the algorithm and
the secret are identical by design, so the swap is a configuration change and
no code in this service is expected to change. If yours needs a code change,
something in it is coupled to the stub rather than to the token, and that is
worth finding now rather than in week 9.

## The Dockerfile and the compose entry

The service has to run as a container built from a multi-stage Dockerfile in
this folder.

`Dockerfile.example` is the naive single-stage version. It works, and it is
wrong in the ways the criterion is about: the image it produces carries Maven,
a full JDK, the whole dependency cache and your source code, it runs as root,
and it rebuilds every dependency whenever one line of code changes. Read the
comments in it, then write `Dockerfile` properly. It is assessed, so the
improvement is yours rather than the scaffold's.

What a correct one does:

- Builds in one stage on an image that has Maven and a JDK 21, and runs from a
  separate final stage on a runtime image that has neither.
- Copies the built jar out of the build stage rather than building again.
- Runs as a user that is not root.
- Orders the copies so that a change to a source file does not invalidate the
  layer holding the resolved dependencies.
- Exposes the service port and answers a health check.

One constraint decides the shape of the build stage. This service resolves the
Sprint 5 domain module from a local Maven repository, and the image build has
no access to the one on your laptop. The build stage therefore has to build
both projects, which means the build context has to contain both folders. Set
the context and the Dockerfile path in the compose file accordingly.

Adding the service to `docker-compose.yml` is your change, in your own copy of
the repository. A correct entry:

| Needs | Because |
|---|---|
| A `build` block with the context and the Dockerfile path | The image is built from source, not pulled |
| `profiles: [platform]` | It starts with `--profile platform`, alongside the auth stub, and not with the bare infrastructure |
| `networks: [trading-net]` | It resolves `postgres` and `auth-stub` by service name |
| A published port for the service port | `curl` from the host reaches it |
| Database host, port, name, user and password from the environment | The compose service name is `postgres`, not `localhost`, and `localhost` inside a container is the container |
| `JWT_SECRET` passed through from `.env` | It has to be the same secret the stub signed with |
| `depends_on` Postgres, on its health condition | Starting before the database is ready is a crash loop, not a failure |
| A health check | `docker compose ps` should tell you the service is up, not merely running |

Nothing in this sprint needs Kafka. The broker starts with the infrastructure
and this service ignores it until Sprint 7.

## The toolchain

Java 21 and Maven 3.9 or later, Spring Boot, MyBatis, the Postgres JDBC driver
and Docker.

```bash
cd sprint-05-domain-engine && mvn install    # publish the domain module first

cd sprint-06-trade-api
mvn clean verify                             # build and test
mvn spring-boot:run                          # run against the compose stack

scripts/check.sh                             # the acceptance harness
scripts/check.sh --live                      # and the endpoint probes
```

There is no aggregator build. This service resolves your Sprint 5 module from
your local Maven repository by its coordinates, so `mvn install` there has to
happen before `mvn verify` here, and again whenever the domain changes.

Those coordinates appear in three places and all three have to agree: the
`<groupId>`, `<artifactId>` and `<version>` in `sprint-05-domain-engine/pom.xml`,
the `domain.groupId`, `domain.artifactId` and `domain.version` properties in
`pom.xml` here, and `DOMAIN_GROUP_ID`, `DOMAIN_ARTIFACT_ID` and
`DOMAIN_VERSION` in `manifest.env`. The scaffold ships them set to what the
Sprint 5 scaffold declares. If your team changed them there, change them in
both places here.

The package tree ships as empty packages, each with a `package-info.java`
stating what belongs in it. Rename or reorganise them if your design says
something else, and tell the harness what you chose in `manifest.env`.

`src/main/resources/application.yml` is a skeleton of the sections the service
needs, with comments and without values. Every value that differs between a
laptop and a container is read from an environment variable with a default
that works under Docker Compose. The connection details are in
`infra/README.md`. No secret is committed, including the development ones: a
signing secret that appears in a properties file is a signing secret in the
history of the repository forever.

## Acceptance criteria

These are the criteria your instructor assesses against.

1. All six endpoints are implemented and match the contract, including the
   error envelope and every code in the catalogue.
2. Layering is enforced: no SQL in a controller, no HTTP type in the domain.
3. MyBatis mappers use parameterised statements throughout.
4. `@ControllerAdvice` maps every domain exception to its documented code and
   status.
5. Order placement is `@Transactional`.
6. Optimistic locking is applied on the account version column.
7. A protected route rejects a missing or invalid token with `AUTH-401`.
8. The service builds and runs from a multi-stage Dockerfile.

## Evaluation

This sprint contributes 18 marks to the 100-mark Capstone assessment. The
package tree, configuration skeleton, harness and example Dockerfile carry no
marks unchanged. A build on its own earns no marks. The team is assessed on
the service behaviour it implements and demonstrates.

| Criterion | Marks |
|---|---:|
| Six endpoints, response bodies, error envelope and catalogue compliance | 4 |
| Controller, service and mapper separation with central exception mapping | 3 |
| Parameterised MyBatis persistence, transactions and concurrency control | 4 |
| JWT verification, account authorisation and safe failure responses | 3 |
| Unit, slice and live contract evidence | 3 |
| Multi-stage container build and Compose integration | 1 |
| **Total** | **18** |

## The check harness

`scripts/check.sh` asserts the things a machine can assert. It has two modes.

**Static mode** is the default. It needs no container, no database and no
running service, and it never calls the Fauxnance API. Run it as often as you
like.

```bash
scripts/check.sh
```

| Check | What it proves |
|---|---|
| `mvn clean verify` succeeds from a clean state | The service builds and its own tests pass, from the files in the repository |
| Your Sprint 5 artefact resolves from your local Maven repository | Criterion 2, the dependency half, and that `mvn install` happened there |
| No `jakarta.servlet`, Spring or MyBatis type in that artefact's compiled classes | Criterion 2, the domain half |
| No `${}` in any mapper statement, XML or annotation | Criterion 3 |
| The order placement path carries `@Transactional` | Criterion 5 |
| A `@ControllerAdvice` or equivalent exists | Criterion 4, the existence half |
| Controller sources import no mapper, JDBC or MyBatis type, and hold no SQL literal | Criterion 2, the controller half |
| `Dockerfile` has more than one stage and its final stage is not a build image | Criterion 8 |
| The account version column appears in a mapper that updates | Criterion 6, the static half |

**Live mode** adds the endpoint probes. It needs your stack up: your schema and
seed data applied, the auth stub running, and your service running and
reachable.

```bash
docker compose --profile platform up -d --build
scripts/check.sh --live
```

| Probe | What it proves |
|---|---|
| A token is obtained from the auth stub and accepted | Criterion 7, the positive half |
| A missing token and an invalid token on a protected route | Criterion 7: both `AUTH-401`, both in the envelope |
| All six endpoints answer with the status and the body shape the contract states | Criterion 1 |
| An unknown account, an unknown instrument, an inactive account, an unaffordable buy, a reused idempotency key and an invalid field | Criterion 1, the catalogue half: the envelope and the code for each |
| Several concurrent orders against one account, with the cash movement reconciled afterwards | Criterion 6, behaviourally: a lost update shows up as cash that did not move |

The harness reads your base package, your layer packages, your Sprint 5
coordinates and the names live mode needs from `manifest.env`, so it asserts
your design rather than dictating one. Live mode makes no assumption about your
schema: it goes through your API, and the only names it needs are the demo user
whose token reaches an active account, the demo user whose account you seeded
inactive, and one symbol you seeded as tradable.

### What passing does not mean

The harness reads structure, not meaning. It confirms that a mapper binds its
parameters without knowing whether the statement is the right one, and that an
annotation is present without knowing whether the transaction boundary is
where it should be.

Assessed by a human at the review, and not by this script:

- whether the transaction boundary encloses the work that has to be atomic,
  and nothing more
- whether every domain exception reaches the advice and leaves as its
  documented code, rather than most of them
- whether the layering holds in the places a grep cannot see, including a
  business rule written in a service that should have called the domain
- whether the optimistic lock is applied to every write to the account row
- whether the response bodies match the contract field for field, including
  the two meanings of `accountId`
- whether the image would survive being deployed, including what it runs as

Bring to the review: the running stack, one order traced from the request to
the committed row, your Dockerfile, and your answer to what happens when two
customers spend the same money at the same moment.
