"""EXAMPLE. Delete this file once your own tests use the fixtures.

It exists to show the mechanics: a fixture from `conftest.py` arrives as an
argument, the parsed envelope is an ordinary dictionary, and no network is
involved. It asserts things about the canned data rather than about your code,
which is why it passes on an empty scaffold and why it is worth nothing as
evidence.

Your real tests go in files named for what they cover, `test_transform.py` for
the transform. At least one of them must feed the malformed fixture through
your transform and assert what happens to each bad row. Name that test for what
it asserts, so it can be run and read on its own.
